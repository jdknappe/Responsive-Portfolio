			<h2>Bio</h2>
			<p>Daft Punk are a French electronic music duo formed by Guy-Manuel Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter in 1993. Together,
				they achieved great success and popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French House movement and have enjoyed continuing
				success years after. Their style of music combines elements of house music with funk, rock, techno, disco, and synthpop
				influences. Daft Punk's most recognizable contributions in recent years include their latest album, "Random Access Memories",
				featuring their lead single titled, "Get Lucky", which was an international success peaking on top 10 charts in
				<strong>32</strong> countries.</p>

			<p>Daft Punk are mainly recognized by their 'robotic' appearance, with Thomas Bangalter sporting a silver/chrome helmet and
				Guy-Manuel with a helmet featuring a gold/brass-like appearance. They very rarely show their faces in videos and television
				interviews. Because of this, the mystery of their identity and the added complexity behind their disguises have contributed
				to their popularity.</p>
